# Jetbrains-Tictactoe-With-AI

This project was created as part of the Jetbrains Academy Python track. The objective of this
project was to create a Tic Tac Toe game with support for both human and AI players. For
the latter, 3 levels of difficulty were implemented, the highest of which uses the minimax algorithm
to find the best possible move for the AI player. 

The project requirements didn't include a great UI, so the prompt just asks for "Input command:" and
expects something of the form:

start user [easy|medium|hard] 

where user specifies that the human player will be X and the computer will be O. 2 users, or 2
computer players are also possible.

The game will expect human players to enter their move coordinates in the form

[row] [col]
